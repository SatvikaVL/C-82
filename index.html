                Q1: Write about visual studio and how to set it up
            </p>
            <p>
                Q1 Ans: Visual Studio Code is an app used for coding javascript, CSS and HTML. It can be used to code websites or learn basic coding. To use it, you need to first install the app on your laptop or desktop. After that, make an empty folder (or dowload the folder if you want to work on a pre-written code) and open it in Visual Studio Code. You can open it by, selecting the file tab on the top and clicking on the "Open Folder" option inside it (as shown in pic-1). You can also create new files by clicking on the "New File" option inside the tab file or using the shortcut "ctrl+n". To select the language of the file, rename the file to end with ". + the language you want", like this = file_example.html.

                Q2: Write about console screen. And why it is used. And how to open console screen and how to print anything on console
            </p>
            <p>
                Q2 Ans: The console screen is very important part of coding as you can test something on the console screen before printion it on the html screen. To open the console screen, you must go live and right click on the screen that has opened and click the option inspect after you have right clicked. After clicking on inspect, You will get a pop-up bar as shown on pic-2. Then, you must click on the tab named 'Console', which located on the top. To print anything on the console screen, you must write "console.log()" and to write any text in the console, you must write the text inside the pair of brackets with quotation marks like this - "console.log("example")". To print a variable you do not have to use quotation marks inside the brackets.
